#while loop = execute some code WHILE some condition remains true.

#while loops and for loops are forms of iteration. iteration is the process of repeating or looping through
#a set of steps or instructions to iterate the verb form of iteration. be careful of infinate loops
#, they will crash your program and you will have to restart it. Infinate loops are loops that never end.



# name = input("enter your name.")

# while name == "":
#     print("You did not enter your name.")
#     name = input("Enter your name: ") # <--- if you cancel this part out, this creates an infinate loop, THEYA RE BAD YOUR COMPUTER WILL CRASH

# #while will keep repeat as long as condition is met. (in this case, entering nothing)

# print(f"Hello {name}")



# age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# while age < 0:
#     print("Age cant be negetive.")
#     age = int(input("Enter your age: ")) #<--- if you cancel this part out, this creates an infinate loop, THEYA RE BAD YOUR COMPUTER WILL CRASH

# print(f"You are {age} years old.")



# food = input("Enter a food you like. (q to quit): ")

# while not food == "q":
#     print(f"You like {food}")
#     food = input("Enter another food you like (q to quit)")

# print("bye")

# #will keep asking you to enter another food that you like until you type q



# num = int(input("Enter a number 1-10: "))

# while num < 1 or num > 10:
#     print(f"{num} is not valid.")
#     num = int(input("Enter a number 1-10: "))

# print(f"Your number is {num}.")









# for loops (more complex) = execute a block of code a fixed number of times.
# You can iterate over a range, string, sequence, etc.


# for x in range(1, 11, 2): #<--- x = all numbers 1-10 on each run. x is a counter. 2 means it skips each 2nd number
#     print(x)

# print('HAPPY NEW YEAR!')

# #can do for x in reversed(range(1, 11, 2)):





# credit_card = "1234-5678-9012-3456"

# for x in credit_card:
#     print(x)
# #this gets every individual chatacter from creditcard.



# for x in range(1, 21):
#     if x == 13 or x == 15 or x == 19:
#         break #or continue
#     else:
#         print(x)
# # print every number 1-20 but skips over 13 (and 15 and 19). use the CONTINUE keyword to skip over these numbers.
# # keyword BREAK stops the program, its done. only prints number 1-12.
